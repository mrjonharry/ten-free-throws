# Ten Free Throws

This is a single-file HTML game. Deploy with GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new public repo on GitHub (e.g., `ten-free-throws`).
2. Upload **index.html** and this **README.md** to the repo root.
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages** → Source = **Deploy from branch**, Branch = **main**, Folder = **/** (root).
4. Visit `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/ten-free-throws/`.

If you see a 404, confirm:
- The file is named **exactly** `index.html` (lowercase).
- Pages is enabled for the **main** branch, folder **/**.
- Your URL includes the repo name (project pages): `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`.
- Do a hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R).
